# JapanTrener_ByRelaxerR
 Coaching on writing Japanese characters. Writes a transcription in English, you should write this Japanese character (or word) in your notebook. The characters are generated randomly, but can form a real word, so a translation is written for the word. The script includes the calculation of statistics. You will be offered mostly characters that you have not remembered well. You can also view your best symbols or the progress of all symbols.
